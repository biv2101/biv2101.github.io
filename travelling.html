                near Zurich.
            </div>
            <div class="text1">I visited Zurich, Luzerne, Technorama in Wintherthur and St. Gallen</div>
            <div class="text1">It was a 14-day trip there and I so much fun.</div>
            <div class="text1">Don't have any pics since they were on a very old phone that is now in the trash.</div>

            <div class="text1"><b>Venice and Verona</b></div>
            <div class="text1">This was my first trip with mom, who was visiting these places again.</div>
            <div class="text1">Venice is one of my favorite places that I have visited. I loved the canals and all the
                vibes.
            </div>
            <div class="text1">I didn't take a gondola ride when I was there for the first time, but I took one last
                year.
            </div>
            <div class="text1">Verona was also fun. The colosseum, the house of Romeo and Juliet and other landmarks.

            <div class="text1">Another trip with mom.</div>
            <div class="text1">Loved Budapest. Loved listening to Johann Strauss while having a boat ride on the Danube.
                10/10 experience
            </div>
            <div class="text1">Loved all the architecture and all the history behind it. Especially for the Lions and
                the architect.
            </div>

            <div class="text1">Vienna was fun as well. Schoenbrunn was HUGE. All the architecture and all the history
                was fantastic.
            </div>
            <div class="text1">Loved Erste Bezirk. First time seeing so much stores in one place. Didn't have time to go
                though them all.
            </div>
            <div class="text1">Apparently Snapchat decided to delete all of my photos so that's why I don't have any.
            </div>
            <div class="text1"><b>9/10 - probably gonna go back to both places, just don't know when</b></div>

            <div class="text1"><b>Madrid</b></div>
            <div class="text1">Went on an Erasmus+ Youth Exchange where I spend 2 weeks near Madrid. Spent in total 4

            <div class="text1"><b>EuroTrip</b></div>
            <div class="text1">Travelled through Venice, Verona, Nice, Cannes, Monaco. For the most part we stayed in
                Lloret de Mar and we went to Barcelona twice.
            </div>
            <div class="text1">It was a bus trip and we went over 8000km. Suffered from sleep deprivation but it was
                fun.
            </div>
            <div class="text1">We partied, we bathed, we had lots of fun.</div>
            <div class="text1">Didn't like Barcelona as much as Madrid.</div>
            <div class="text1">While the whole experience is a 10, the bus riding brings it down to an 8.</div>
